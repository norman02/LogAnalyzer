# **LogAnalyzer**  
A **lightweight, scalable, and intelligent** Python-based log analyzer for IT professionals.  

## **Overview**  
LogAnalyzer simplifies log analysis by parsing logs, categorizing issues, and generating structured reports. It ensures compatibility across multiple log formats and optimizes log processing efficiency.
